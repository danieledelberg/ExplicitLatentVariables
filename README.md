Repository for the preprint "Using VAEs to Learn Latent Variables: Observations on Applications in Cryo-EM"

CryoDRGNVLT/ - Modifications to CryoDRGN to reproduce the VLT experiments.
CryoDRGNEvilTwin/ - Modifications to CryoDRGN to reproduce the Evil Twin experiments
MNIST/ - 4 distinct files to reproduce various experiments performed in the Appendix related to the MNIST results

The CryoDRGN experiments have been adapted to run as similarly as possible to the original CryoDRGN code.
